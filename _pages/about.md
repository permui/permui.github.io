My name is Aoyang Yu (余奥洋 in Chinese). I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Turing Class, Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm). I am expected to graduate in 2023.

I pursued my interests in computer science through **competitive programming** in my early days. The highly educational experience of competing in **Olympiad in Informatics (OI)** during my high school years has a far-reaching influence on me. In my freshman year, I participated in [an **ACM ICPC** Asia Regional Contest](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/AR-Nannjing-2019) and won a gold medal with my team.

I am currently enthusiastic about the fancy world of **Programming Language Theory** and seek to do some research in this field.
