This is the course project of _**Database System**_ in Zhejiang University, completed independently in my first undergraduate year. The primary aim of this project is to design a basic Database Management System that is **efficient, modular, low coupling and extensible**.

Please see the [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/permui/MeSQL){:target="_blank"} for a detailed README and the full code for you to play with.

Here are the original reports of this project that I submitted. The [overall report]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/MeSQL-OverallReport-AoyangYu.pdf){:target="_blank"} discusses the overall structure of the system and component details, while the [index manager report]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/MeSQL-IndexManagerReport-AoyangYu.pdf){:target="_blank"} gives information about some implement details of the B+ tree index. They are written in Chinese.
