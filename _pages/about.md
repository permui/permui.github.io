I am Aoyang Yu (余奥洋 in Chinese), an undergraduate studying computer science at [Turing Class, Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm). I am expected to graduate in 2023.

I am interested in the fancy world of **programming language theory**, **proof assistants** and **homotopy type theory**. I want to do research in these fields!

Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
